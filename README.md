# libggsea

GGSEA is a Graph-to-Graph Seed-and-Extend Alignment on nucleotide sequences. The alignment function takes two [GREF](https://github.com/ocxtal/libgref) objects, match kmers between them and extend the kmers upward and downward, and reports the top N local alignments (paths) between two string graphs.
